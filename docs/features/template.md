As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit/goal].

## Functionality

### Core Features

- Feature point 1
- Feature point 2
- Feature point 3

### User Interface

Describe the UI elements and user interactions for this feature.

### Data Flow

Explain how data moves through the system for this feature.

## Security Considerations

### Attack Surface

#### Inbound Data Vectors
- **User inputs**: Form fields, file uploads, URL parameters
- **File content**: CSV data, configuration files
- **External resources**: CDN scripts, external APIs
- **Browser APIs**: LocalStorage, SessionStorage, IndexedDB

#### Outbound Data Vectors
- **Network requests**: API calls, CDN requests, analytics
- **File downloads**: Generated CSV files, reports
- **Browser storage**: Data persisted locally
- **Console/logs**: Debug information, error messages
- **Clipboard**: Copy/paste operations
- **Print/export**: Screen content, generated documents

#### Trust Boundaries
- **Browser to application**: User-provided data entry points
- **Application to browser**: Data displayed to user
- **Application to external services**: CDN, analytics, external APIs
- **Application to local storage**: Persistent data handling

### Threat Model

- **Threat 1**: [Description] → Mitigation: [How it's addressed]
- **Threat 2**: [Description] → Mitigation: [How it's addressed]
- **Threat 3**: [Description] → Mitigation: [How it's addressed]

Common threats to consider:
- **Data injection**: Malicious data in CSV files, user inputs
- **XSS**: Cross-site scripting through dynamic content
- **Data exfiltration**: Unintended data exposure via downloads/storage
- **Information disclosure**: Sensitive data in logs, exports, or storage
- **Client-side tampering**: Modified JavaScript execution
- **Supply chain**: CDN/external dependency risks
- **Data leakage**: Unintended data in outbound requests or files

### Security Controls

- Input validation mechanisms
- Output encoding/escaping
- Content Security Policy considerations
- Safe defaults and fail-secure behaviors
- Data sanitization for outbound flows
- Secure data storage practices
